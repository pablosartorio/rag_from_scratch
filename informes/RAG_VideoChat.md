Once you've transcribed the audio from the video using Whisper, you can analyze the text to identify key moments and their timings. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Timestamps**: Whisper can generate transcripts with timestamps, which tell you when specific parts of the text occur in the audio.

2. **Keyword Extraction**: You can use keyword extraction tools or algorithms to identify important words or phrases. By correlating these keywords with the timestamps, you can determine when important information is discussed.

3. **Summarization**: Use text summarization algorithms to condense the transcript into shorter summaries. These summaries can then be linked back to the timestamps to highlight key sections of the video.

4. **Text Analysis**: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content for themes, topics, or sentiment, which can help identify the most relevant parts of the transcript.

By combining these methods, you can efficiently summarize the audio content and determine when important information appears in the video.
