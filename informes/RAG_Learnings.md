### **Summary of Improvements and Learnings**

---

### **1. Chroma Vector Database Management**
- **Understanding Database vs. Collection**:
   - A **database** is the storage location (e.g., `chroma_data`, `mi_proyecto_test_chroma_db`).
   - A **collection** is a logical grouping of documents and embeddings within the database.

- **Adding Support for PDFs**:
   - Modified `DBManagement.py` to handle **PDF** files using `PyPDFLoader` while keeping support for text files.
   - Learned how to dynamically load documents, split them into chunks, and add them to the Chroma database without recreating it.

- **Updating vs. Recreating**:
   - Learned how to **add new documents** to an existing collection without deleting the previous data.
   - Understood how to avoid overwriting existing embeddings and ensure incremental updates.

- **Storage**:
   - Documents, embeddings, and Chroma metadata are persisted in a local directory (e.g., `mi_proyecto_test_chroma_db`).

### **2. Running and Managing Services**
- **Service Overview**:
   - Configured and understood how the following services interact:
     - **Chroma Database**: Vector storage service running on `localhost:8000`.
     - **RAGService**: FastAPI-based backend service running on `localhost:8001` for query processing.
     - **GradioService**: User-friendly frontend service running on `localhost:7000` for web-based queries.
   - **Ports**:
     - Learned how to manage and check service ports using `lsof` and `ps` commands.

- **Service Restart and Debugging**:
   - Learned how to:
     - Identify processes using specific ports.
     - Kill hanging processes to restart services cleanly.
     - Verify Chroma server readiness using `curl`.

- **Automated Startup**:
   - Created an all-in-one **startup script** (`start_services.sh`) to launch Chroma, RAGService, and GradioService with logging support.

---

### **3. Proxy and Network Configuration**
- **Gradio Proxy Issues**:
   - Resolved GradioService proxy conflicts by unsetting problematic environment variables (e.g., `ALL_PROXY`).
   - Learned how to persist the solution by adding overrides in the script itself.

- **Remote Access**:
   - Configured the services to be accessible from outside the local machine using:
     - **SSH tunneling** for secure access.
     - Direct HTTP access via a configured IP and port (e.g., `http://10.75.3.95:8001`).

---

### **4. RAG Pipeline Improvements**
- **End-to-End Workflow**:
   - Learned how the **retrieval-augmented generation** (RAG) system works:
     1. **Document Processing**:
        - Documents are split into chunks and embedded using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
     2. **Query Processing**:
        - Queries are sent to the **RAGService**, which retrieves relevant chunks from Chroma.
     3. **LLM Response Generation**:
        - Context and queries are passed to the LLM (Ollama with `llama3.2`), which generates a final response.

- **Testing**:
   - Used `curl` to test the FastAPI endpoint and confirm document retrieval.
   - Learned how to test integration with the Gradio web interface.

---

### **5. Troubleshooting and Debugging**
- **Deprecation Warnings**:
   - Learned to address LangChain deprecation warnings by switching to the `langchain_community` module.

- **Port Conflicts**:
   - Resolved issues where ports were already in use using:
     - `lsof -i :<port>`
     - `kill -9 <PID>`

- **Logs and Monitoring**:
   - Introduced logging for all services to simplify debugging and monitor runtime behavior.

### **6. Key Tools and Commands Learned**
| **Command/Tool**               | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lsof -i :<port>`              | Check which process is using a specific port.                               |
| `kill -9 <PID>`                | Terminate a process by its PID.                                             |
| `curl http://<ip>:<port>`      | Test HTTP endpoints and ensure services are running.                        |
| `ps -fp <PID>`                 | Show details of a specific process.                                         |
| `systemctl status <service>`   | Verify system services (e.g., Ollama).                                      |
| `python <script>.py`           | Run Python scripts for database creation, RAG service, and Gradio service.  |

### **7. Next Steps**
1. **Scalability**:
   - Explore deploying the RAG system as Docker containers to simplify deployment.
2. **Enhanced Document Support**:
   - Add support for Word documents (`.docx`) or other formats using loaders like `UnstructuredFileLoader`.
3. **System Documentation**:
   - Create full project documentation covering workflows, services, and scripts.

### **Conclusion**
You have significantly improved the system's functionality, added robust document processing capabilities, resolved networking issues, and streamlined service management. These enhancements make the project more efficient, flexible, and easier to use. ðŸš€
