Here’s a complete report of what we’ve accomplished so far in the development of your RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system:


# Report: Progress in Building the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

## **Introduction**
This report outlines the progress made so far in the step-by-step development of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The RAG system is being built to integrate document retrieval, embeddings generation, a vector database, a backend service, and a web-based frontend to handle user queries effectively.

---

## **Accomplishments**

### **1. Environment Setup**
- Created a clean and isolated development environment using Conda.
  - Python version: 3.9
  - Dependencies installed via `pip` to ensure compatibility with the latest libraries.
  - Key libraries installed:
    - `langchain`
    - `chromadb`
    - `sentence-transformers`
    - `langchain-huggingface`
    - `transformers`

### **2. Document Loading and Preprocessing**
- Developed a function to load documents from a specified folder
  - **Key Features**:
    - Processes all files within a folder.
    - Reads file contents and stores metadata such as file path.
  - Outputs `Document` objects compatible with LangChain.

- Implemented document chunking using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`:
  - Chunk size: 500 characters.
  - Overlap: 100 characters.
  - Ensured chunks maintain contextual coherence.

---

### **3. Vector Database Setup**
- Configured Chroma as the vector database for storing document embeddings:
  - Enabled automatic persistence with `persist_directory` set to `./chroma_db`.
  - Verified that persistence is functional and embeddings are stored correctly.

- Added support for embedding generation using Hugging Face models:
  - Model used: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
  - Integrated embeddings into Chroma with seamless chunk-to-vector conversion.

---

### **4. Code Refinement**
- Addressed deprecation warnings and updated imports to align with the latest LangChain modules.
  - Switched from `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` to `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` from `langchain-huggingface`.
- Removed unnecessary method calls like `db.persist()` as persistence is now automated in the latest `langchain_chroma`.

---

### **5. Functional Verification**
- Conducted end-to-end testing of the document processing and vector database population.
  - Verified document ingestion, chunking, embedding generation, and storage.
  - Ensured that all data was correctly persisted in the Chroma directory.

---

## **Key Learnings and Challenges**
1. **Deprecation Warnings**:
   - Resolved issues by transitioning to updated modules (`langchain-huggingface`).
   - Installed the latest dependencies to ensure compatibility.

2. **Persistence**:
   - Clarified how Chroma handles persistence, ensuring data is automatically saved to disk.

3. **Chunking**:
   - Tuned chunk size and overlap parameters to balance coherence and granularity.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up the Gradio web interface to handle user input and display responses.

2. **Backend Service**:
   - Develop the backend service using FastAPI to connect the Gradio frontend with ChromaDB.

3. **LLM Integration**:
   - Incorporate a local language model (e.g., LLaMA or GPT) for query processing and response generation.

4. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Conduct integration testing to validate the entire RAG pipeline.

---

## **Conclusion**
Significant progress has been made in setting up the foundational components of the RAG system. The focus now shifts to building the frontend and backend services and integrating the LLM to enable end-to-end functionality. The project remains on track with robust document handling and vector storage capabilities successfully implemented.
